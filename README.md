# ML-Agents - Exploration of Machine Learning
This repository is an open-source exploration of ML Agents and it's features.

I will be using this Unity Project as a learning tool.

I have no put the Python Environment in the repository, as it is HUGE. I will look into writing a script in the future that creates the Environment for anybody that should need it.
